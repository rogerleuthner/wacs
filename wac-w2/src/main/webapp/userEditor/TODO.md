

could implement a wizard flow

either put the dnd 'type' to use or disable it

remove phone number or use masking

remove 8 character password requirement

null pointer exception after adding new user and then trying to select a user to edit
at com.tf.wac.data.domain.User.getChannelRoles(User.java:180)
and the new user doesn't show up to be edited

need to figure out how to add user to the dashboard groups etc.
 - might one option be to integrate the two databases?
