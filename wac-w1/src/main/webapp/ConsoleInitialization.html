	<!-- Init WAC.js and EventSource/storage-based inter and intra-console eventing.
		Requires: initialized WAC.js object, OWF, EventSource and localStorage (@see WACinit.js)
		
		1) If running in OWF, get the logged user name and set it into the WAC data
		2) Set up console-wide EventReceiver subscribing to all events defined in WAC.ALL_EVENTS
		
		May throw exceptions; if so, the setup for OWF and Events probably failed.
